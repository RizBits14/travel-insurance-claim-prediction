Travel Insurance Claim Prediction & Customer Segmentation

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict whether a customer will make a travel insurance claim and to segment customers using unsupervised clustering.
It demonstrates a full workflow from data exploration to model evaluation and includes a final report with visual insights.

Dataset

Total Records: 63,326

Target Variable: Claim (1 = Claim, 0 = No Claim)

Class Imbalance: Only ~1.5% claims

Feature	Description
Agency	Name of the travel agency
Agency Type	Type of agency (e.g., Corporate)
Product Name	Insurance product name
Duration	Travel duration (days)
Destination	Destination country
Net Sales	Total sales amount
Age	Age of customer
Gender	Gender of customer
Claim	Whether a claim was made
Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (Gender â†’ "Unknown")

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features

Addressed imbalance using class_weight='balanced'

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Claim distribution

Correlation heatmap

Claim rate by agency, product, and region

Model Building (Supervised Learning)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Neural Network (MLP)

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC

Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means)

Grouped customers into three clusters

Evaluated using Silhouette Score (0.28)

Model Performance (Supervised)
Metric	Logistic Regression	Decision Tree	Neural Network
Accuracy	0.7952	0.9713	0.9854
Precision	0.0517	0.0680	0.0000
Recall	0.7514	0.0757	0.0000
AUC	0.8312	0.5319	0.8383

Key Insight:
Logistic Regression performed best for identifying claims due to high recall and balanced AUC.
